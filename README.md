FFXIV TexTools by Liinko


# Disclaimer 

This code was written as the game files were being researched and experimented on, as such, the code is messy. There is a lot of redundancies, hard-coded ints and strings, it can have confusing variable and method names that donâ€™t follow any specific coding convention, and overall lazy and inefficient coding.

I decided to leave things the way they are and release them because I am in the process of moving everything to WPF, with clean and efficient code now that the bulk of the research is done. The WPF version will be uploaded upon its completion.
